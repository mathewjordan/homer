Curtiss (1869-1967). In correspondence relating to his gift, Frederic H. Curtiss first stated that the painting had been in his family \"since sometime before 1870, having been bought by my father\" (November 13, 1940). He later wrote that it \"was purchased before 1873\" (January 3, 1944). \r\n\r\n[2] Abijah Curtiss did not bequeath \"Pitching Quoits\" directly to his son Frederic H. Curtiss in his will (probated August 7, 1888). Therefore, it must have descended in the family. In 1911, William Howe Downes listed Frederic H. Curtiss as the owner of \"Pitching Quoits.\""]}}],"label":{"none":["Pitching Quoits"]},"requiredStatement":{"label":{"none":["Attribution"]},"value":{"none":["Harvard Art Museums"]}},"thumbnail":[{"id":"https://ids.lib.harvard.edu/ids/iiif/474743217/full/!170,170/0/default.jpg","type":"Image","service":[{"@id":"https://ids.lib.harvard.edu/ids/iiif/474743217","@type":"ImageService2","profile":"level2"}]}],"partOf":[{"id":"https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/collections","type":"Collection"}],"rendering":[{"id":"https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/collections/object/299837","type":"Text","format":"text/html","label":{"none":["Full record view"]}}],"items":[{"id":"https://iiif.harvardartmuseums.org/manifests/object/299837/canvas/canvas-474743217","type":"Canvas","height":1251,"width":2550,"label":{"none":["1"]},"annotations":[{"id":"https://iiif.harvardartmuseums.org/manifests/object/299837/list/474743217","type":"AnnotationPage"}],"items":[{"id":"https://iiif.harvardartmuseums.org/manifests/object/299837/canvas/canvas-474743217/annotation-page","type":"AnnotationPage","items":[{"id":"https://iiif.harvardartmuseums.org/manifests/object/299837/annotation/anno-474743217","type":"Annotation","motivation":"painting","target":"https://iiif.harvardartmuseums.org/manifests/object/299837/canvas/canvas-474743217","body":{"id":"https://ids.lib.harvard.edu/ids/iiif/474743217/full/full/0/default.jpg","type":"Image","height":1251,"width":2550,"format":"image/jpeg","service":[{"@id":"https://ids.lib.harvard.edu/ids/iiif/474743217","@type":"ImageService2","profile":"level2"}]}}]}]},{"id":"https://iiif.harvardartmuseums.org/manifests/object/299837/canvas/canvas-17386323","type":"Canvas","height":1272,"width":2550,"label":{"none":["2"]},"annotations":[{"id":"https://iiif.harvardartmuseums.org/manifests/object/299837/list/17386323","type":"AnnotationPage"}],"items":[{"id":"https://iiif.harvardartmuseums.org/manifests/object/299837/canvas/canvas-17386323/annotation-page","type":"AnnotationPage","items":[{"id":"https://iiif.harvardartmuseums.org/manifests/object/299837/annotation/anno-17386323","type":"Annotation","motivation":"painting","target":"https://iiif.harvardartmuseums.org/manifests/object/299837/canvas/canvas-17386323","body":{"id":"https://ids.lib.harvard.edu/ids/iiif/17386323/full/full/0/default.jpg","type":"Image","height":1272,"width":2550,"format":"image/jpeg","service":[{"@id":"https://ids.lib.harvard.edu/ids/iiif/17386323","@type":"ImageService2","profile":"level2"}]}}]}]}]},"related":["https://mathewjordan.github.io/homer/api/facet/date/1865.json?sort=random","https://mathewjordan.github.io/homer/api/facet/classification/paintings.json?sort=random"],"seo":{"title":"Pitching Quoits - Winslow Homer","canonical":"https://mathewjordan.github.io/homer/works/pitching-quoits","openGraph":{"images":[{"url":"https://ids.lib.harvard.edu/ids/iiif/474743217/full/!170,170/0/default.jpg","type":"","width":200,"height":200,"alt":"Pitching Quoits"}]}},"referencingContent":[]},"__N_SSG":true}
